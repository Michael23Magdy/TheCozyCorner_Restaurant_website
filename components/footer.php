        <p>Founded in 2010, The Cozy Corner started as a small family-owned restaurant with a big dream: to bring comfort and joy through delicious food. Over the years, we've grown, but our mission remains the same. Our dedication to quality ingredients and exceptional service has made us a beloved destination for both locals and visitors alike. From our humble beginnings to now, every dish we serve tells the story of our passion and commitment.</p>
